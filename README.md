## ‚ùó WARNING

I am not responsible for your account being banned as a result of you using any of these plugins or BetterDiscord.

Keep in mind, some of the plugins make calls to Discord's API which can get you banned for self botting.

### üì• Where can I download the plugins?

Go to the [plugins directory](Plugins/)

### ü§î Why are these "banned"?

I've considered these plugins "banned" because they aren't available on [BetterDiscord's official plugin repository](https://betterdiscord.app/plugins).

### ü•∏ Are you the original author of the plugins?

No, however the author of the plugins are shown in the README of each plugin, along with different links provided by the authors such as donation links.

Please show love to the real authors of these plugins by visiting their repos and staring them. This repo only acts as an index of all the different plugins.

If you are an author of a plugin and you wish for your plugin to be taken down, please contact me.
