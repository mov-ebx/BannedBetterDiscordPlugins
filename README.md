## :warning: Important (please read)

The use of BetterDiscord and especially these plugins are against Discord's Terms of Service. Discord doesn't really care and bans are extremely rare, the odds of getting banned are likely 0 unless you are mass reported or something. Being open about using BetterDiscord plugins also may result in specific servers banning you, so keep it a secret and you'll probably get away with it.

## Where can I download the plugins?

Go to the [plugins directory](Plugins/)

### Are you the original author of the plugins?

No, however the author of the plugins are shown in the README of each plugin, along with different links provided by the authors such as donation links.

Please show love to the real authors of these plugins by visiting their repos and staring them. This repo only acts as an index of all the different plugins.

If you are an author of a plugin and you wish for your  plugin to be taken down, please contact me.
